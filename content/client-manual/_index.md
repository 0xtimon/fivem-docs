Basics
------
- [Installing FiveM](/client-manual/installing-fivem)
- [Console commands](/client-manual/console-commands)

FiveM singleplayer
------------------
FiveM also ships with a special singleplayer mode. This brings the FiveM experience to singleplayer. For this to work,
you do need to have a valid savegame from the original game. Save your game at least once before starting FiveM SP.

Using plugins
-------------
FiveM allows the use of certain plugins. You can install these by going to your plugins folder within FiveM's
application data folder. If you have no such folder yet, you can create it. Within this folder you can place
the same type of .asi scripts you always used.

Beware:

- Servers have the option to disallow the use of plugins. Therefor, you might not be able to use your plugins at all
  servers you play on.
- Use at your own risk. Some plugins are outdated and/or not compatible with FiveM and potentially crash your game.
  FiveM is not responsible for any such event and will not provide support to the use of plugins.

Server Browser
--------------
The server browser allows for some neat searching tricks:

- Type `~foo ~bar` to exclude servers running foo or bar
