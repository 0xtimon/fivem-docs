title: System requirements
---

To [run FiveM][installing], make sure your system meets the [minimum requirements of the original game][gtav-system-specs].
Also, make sure you meet the FiveM specific requirements:

- **OS**: A _fully_ updated version of Windows 7, Windows 8.1 or Windows 10. An outdated operating system may not work.
  It is generally adviced to upgrade to Windows 10 when you can as this provides the best experience.
- **Processor**: Same as GTA V. A more powerful processor may improve performance depending on the server you play on.
- **Memory**: Same as GTA V. More memory may improve performance depending on the server you play on.
- **Video card**: Same as GTA V with the exception of older laptop AMD cards. There is a known issue with CEF on certain
  video card models/drivers which may not work with older cards. Read more about that [here][client-issues-gpu].
- **HDD space**: 5GB+. FiveM caches the content of servers meaning it will require more disk space depending on the
  servers you join.
