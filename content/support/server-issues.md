Could not load sessionmanager
-----------------------------

This sometimes happens when you run your server for the first time, or after you
clear the cache folder. Run `restart sessionmanager` in your server console, or
restart your server once, and you're good to go.

My server does not show up in the server list
---------------------------------------------

When this happens, make sure other people can connect to your server using
direct connect. This issue usually is a result of bad port forwarding or some
firewall issue. Make sure your network configuration is correct.
