title: Scripting runtimes

If youre new to scripting, read the introduction first. If youre unsure what language you should choose, remember that
no matter what you choose it will get the job done. Pick something youre already comfortable with, or something which
you think is the most useful to you. There is no best practice. If you're still unsure, Lua is a safe choice.
