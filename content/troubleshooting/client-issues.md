Getting game crashes? Can't launch FiveM? Or maybe running into some more
obscure issue? Find your issue here.

The server I play on crashes!
-----------------------------
This is most likely an issue with the server you are playing on. Contact the
server owners to take a look at your issue. If you want to be absolutely sure
your game works as intended, join the [vanilla FiveM server][vanilla-server].
This is a mostly empty FiveM server and should always work.

Certain antivirus vendors are known to block FiveM for unknown reasons. Disable
your antivirus and try again.

Stuck on a black screen
-----------------------
This is a common problem with nvidia drivers. It takes a minute to load. Happens
in other games too.

Colored background but no menu
------------------------------
This happens on older AMD laptop GPUs. CEF is the cause, you can disable CEF
like so: `command here`. Do note that you will not be able to use CEF in
servers though.
